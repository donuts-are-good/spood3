      <p class="proc-lede"><span class="drop-cap">D</span>uring Thursday’s card, the in-arena scoreboard relinquished control to Compliance Channel 7B for exactly four minutes and seventeen seconds. Viewers witnessed a flickering tree carved in phosphor, annotated with surnames that refused to hold still. The Department regrets the interruption and assures patrons the footage was purely educational.</p>
      <p class="proc-lede cont">We remind citizens that heritage auditing is a routine service. Any resemblance between the illustrated “lineage braids” and fighters presently on the schedule is the result of diligent bookkeeping and not a sales tactic.</p>

        <dd>Overlay injects beige banner: “REPORT UNSANCTIONED BLENDS · Dial *777”. Phone number quietly routes to the Heritage Arbitration desk.</dd>
        <dt>20:14:42</dt>
        <dd>Camera three captures a technician rearranging two glowing sigils like cufflinks. Feed blinks, returns to the bout, but leaves a ghost of connected initials above Fighter Two.</dd>
        <dt>20:15:10</dt>
        <dd>Audio loop (male, courteous): “If you have witnessed duplicate sigils, congratulations on your excellent eyesight.” Crowd noise resumes underneath.</dd>
        <dt>20:16:22</dt>
        <dd>Lower-third chyron: “Research Permit Recall Notice — click to surrender unauthorized gratitude packages.”</dd>

        <li>“Heritage Arbitration Services” now sponsors the 3rd bout intermission. Their pamphlet includes a tasteful fold-out map of approved genome studios.</li>
        <li>Schedule banners will temporarily cycle a muted PSA reminding spectators that rogue lab vans are “probably a mirage.”</li>
        <li>Captains may request complimentary ink to trace familial braids on chalkboard during press briefings. Please keep diagrams under four branches to avoid dizziness.</li>

      <div class="rf-title">Field Notes from the Rogue Gene Lab</div>
      <p>The lab’s hospitality desk insists everything is “family programming.” Complimentary eye shields are offered before patrons tour the centrifuge alcove. A brochure titled <em>“Familial Harmonization for Beginners”</em> features a discreet coupon in the gutter—stamped with the same sigil that haunted the broadcast. Clerks deny knowledge of any coupon, then whisper that it expires when the copper taste fades.</p>
      <p>Patrons are encouraged to surrender any unused gratitude packages for “upcycling.” In exchange, they receive a laminated warning about what happens if a hybrid traces its pedigree past three generations without adult supervision. The warning glows faintly when held over the schedule.</p>

      <ul style="margin:.6em 0 0 1.2em;">
        <li>The lineage tree only appears to those already in possession of a sponsor’s ledger. Everyone else saw polite static.</li>
        <li>Multiple spectators swore the beige PSA banner smelled like ozone and violets. Compliance technicians attribute this to “routine ventilation.”</li>
        <li>A single frame reportedly displayed the phrase “MANUAL GENE BLENDING UNLOCKED.” That frame has since been replaced with a tasteful urn.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <section class="closing" style="margin:1.5em 2em;">
      <p><strong>Action Items:</strong> Captains should confirm their fighters’ lineage badges before the next weigh-in. Spectators should ignore any trunk pop-up vendors offering “mobile arbitration.” Anyone discovering a beige banner in their personal schedule is urged to file Form L-3 quietly and bring a friend with a calm disposition.</p>
      <p>The Department appreciates your discretion and reminds you: do not lick the compliance overlays.</p>
