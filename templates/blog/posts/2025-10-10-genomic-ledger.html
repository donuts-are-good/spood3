      <p class="proc-lede"><span class="drop-cap">B</span>y quiet instruction from the Office Whose Lights Are Never Off, the Department has affixed to every registered combatant a <em>genomic sigil</em>: a string of sanctioned characters computed from the very facts of their being. This sigil, hereafter <strong>GENOME</strong>, is inscribed in the public ledger beside the usual inventory of digits, sorrows, and wins. Clerks will not explain it. The Commissioner will not be asked.</p>
      <aside class="callout-zombie">
        <p>Verification Notice: Captains shall present their fighters for <strong>digit recount</strong> before, during, and after any ceremony in which a GENOME changes temperament. Acceptable variance remains ≤ ±2. Clerks fainting does not pause recounts.</p>
      </aside>
      <p class="proc-lede cont">The GENOME is not medical advice, not a password, not a prayer. It is, however, <em>binding</em>. Those who attempt to peel it off will discover that it peels back. Those who synchronize their breathing with it may hear the distant bells.</p>

      <p><strong>Method:</strong> Each fighter’s known qualities were marched in solemn order past a scribe of unfathomable patience, who rendered them to a 512‑degree seal. The seal answers only to itself and to <em>Procedure</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Scope:</strong> All franchises. Captains are accountable for timely recounts of fingers and toes, and for ensuring no fighter arrives to inspection with a borrowed horoscope.</p>
      <p><strong>Observations:</strong> Some sigils hum. Others taste faintly of copper. A few refuse to be witnessed directly unless you stand at an angle and pretend you’re reading something else.</p>
      <p><strong>Public Access:</strong> The ledger will expose GENOMES in redacted form (leading hex only) to discourage recreational summoning. Full forms will be available to qualified clerks wearing the hat.</p>
      <p><strong>Ethical Review:</strong> The Committee on Helpful Questions has been dismissed early for asking them.</p>
